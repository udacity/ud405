# 2D Game Development with LibGDX

This repository contains all the code for the free Udacity class [ud405: 2D Game Development with LibGDX](https://www.udacity.com/course/2d-game-development-with-libgdx--ud405). These demos and exercises were designed to accompany the course, but are a fine learning resource in their own right.

You can download this code using the gray "Download ZIP" button.

Instructions for importing and running these projects can be found in the [1.2.01-Demo-GettingStartedWithLibGDX](https://github.com/udacity/ud405/tree/master/1.2.01-Demo-GettingStartedWithLibGDX) folder.

Issues and pull requests welcome!
