# 2D Game Development with LibGDX

This repository contains all the code for the free Udacity class [ud405: 2D Game Development with LibGDX](https://www.udacity.com/course/2d-game-development-with-libgdx--ud405). These demos and exercises were designed to accompany the course, but are a fine learning resource in their own right.

You can download this code using the green "Clone or download" button at the top right.

Instructions for importing and running these projects can be found in the [1.2.01-Demo-GettingStartedWithLibGDX](https://github.com/udacity/ud405/tree/master/1.2.01-Demo-GettingStartedWithLibGDX) folder.

Issues and pull requests welcome!
